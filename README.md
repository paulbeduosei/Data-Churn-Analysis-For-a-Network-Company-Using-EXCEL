# Data-Churn-Analysis-For-a-Network-Company-Using-EXCEL
Just wrapped up a deep-dive churn analysis for an anonymous company, Databel, turning raw customer data into actionable business intelligence!

Customer churn is a critical metric, and I recently applied my analytical skills to understand Databel's attrition patterns. I leveraged pivot tables and custom equations to segment the customer base and calculate key performance indicators.

Insights include:

Contract-Based Churn: The analysis clearly showed that month-to-month customers have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those on 1-year or 2-year contracts, highlighting a critical area for immediate retention focus.

Usage/Value Correlation: By using calculated fields to determine the official Churn Rate (%) (Lost Customers÷Total Starting Customers)×100, I identified a correlation between high churn and a low average monthly spend, suggesting that low-value, high-maintenance customers are a significant flight risk.

Time-Based Cohorts: Using formulas for Cohort Analysis, I tracked customer retention over their first six months, pinpointing exactly when new customers are most likely to drop off post-onboarding.

This data-driven approach allows Databel to shift from reactive damage control to proactive, targeted retention strategies. It's rewarding to see how structured analysis can directly influence business strategy!
